Setting up a new Express project often means dealing with repetitive decisions: which middleware to use, how to structure folders, and how to configure dependencies that all solve similar problems in slightly different ways.

**create-exstart** is a CLI tool designed to remove that friction by letting you scaffold a new Express.js project through an interactive setup process.

Instead of cloning a fixed template, you generate a project based on your actual choices.

## Features

- Interactive CLI wizard for project setup
- Dependency selection during scaffolding
- Generates a clean and consistent Express project structure
- Reduces boilerplate and setup time for new APIs

The goal is to make starting an Express project as quick and painless as creating a new Next.js app.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g create-exstart
```

Verify installation:

```bash
create-exstart --version
```

## Usage

Create a new Express project by running:

```bash
npx create-exstart <project-name>
```

Follow the prompts to select dependencies and configure your project. Once completed, you’re ready to start building immediately.

## Contribution

The project is open to contributions. Improvements, bug fixes, and feature ideas are welcome via issues and merge requests.
