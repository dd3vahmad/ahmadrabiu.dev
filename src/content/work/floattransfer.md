I worked as a Full-stack Developer at Float Transfer, a cross-border remittance platform focused on fast and secure international money transfers.

- Built and maintained scalable backend services to support cross-border payment flows and high-volume transactions.
- Implemented and optimized deployment workflows, improving release reliability and reducing manual deployment errors.
- Redesigned and improved the public website and in-app user interfaces, leading to better usability and overall user experience.
- Integrated KYC (Know Your Customer) services to strengthen platform security, ensure regulatory compliance, and reduce fraud.
- Carried out multiple UI fixes and performance improvements across the application, enhancing stability and user satisfaction.

My work focused on improving system reliability, security, and user experience across both the backend and frontend of the platform.
