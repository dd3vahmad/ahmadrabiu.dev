I worked as a Full-stack Developer at UpTime, a SaaS platform focused on reliability, monitoring, and operational visibility for modern systems.

- Led a complete rebuild of the product’s backend architecture, improving scalability, maintainability, and long-term reliability.
- Designed and implemented a secure authentication system, covering user sign-up, login, session management, and access control.
- Built the full onboarding flow, enabling smooth user and organization setup from first contact to active usage.
- Implemented tenant-based access control, ensuring proper isolation of data and permissions across organizations and teams.
- Developed major frontend features and core application flows, translating product requirements into clean, usable interfaces.
- Collaborated closely with product direction to align system design with real-world operational needs.

My work focused on building a strong technical foundation for UpTime, enabling secure multi-tenant usage, smooth onboarding, and future product scalability.
